# Go Modules

## What is a go module? 

> It's simply a Go project that _lives outside of your $GOPATH._

## Package management in Go
 
 - Go Modules' `mod.go` files are somewhat similar to `package.json` files for JS projects;
 they help us keep track of our dependencies using semver. 
 
 - Go Modules also uses a hash for content of specific versions, in `go.sum`.
 Similar to `lockfile`/`shrinkwrap` in the JS ecosystem, as it helps us "pin" specific dependency versions.
